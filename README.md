Hotel Reservation API
======================

#1 A  hotel reservation booking system written using AngularJS, loopback frwamework for Node.js API and NodeJS platform.

##2 Initial setup
=============

###3 I used loopback.js to scaffold this project using the `loopback generator built ontop of express` generator.  For this to work, you run:
    
    npm install -g strongloop
    npm install -g loopback-cli
    
After then only you are able to use Yeoman to scaffold the project:

    slc loopback:app name
